# Chess
Chess app- command line version
---------------------------------
Implemented via Java and Object Oriented Programming.
When run the command terminal prints out a preset chess board with all associated peices. Programmatically the chessboard is represented as a double array of the Object Peice. Each Peice subtype (King, Queen, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Pawn) extended Peice and inherieted the object's methods and variables. The command line would take each successive move (e2 e3) and determine if the move is a vaild move (all possible basic moves for each peice as well as enpassant and encastling) for the peice before executing it. The program also detects when a move is put the opposing player's king into check. The program also allows for the player for call for a draw or for the player to resign from the game.
